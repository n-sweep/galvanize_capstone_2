# Used Instrument Value Estimator

Used instruments are the lifeblood of small music retailers. Even titans like Guitar Center and Sweetwater gladly engage in the thriving used guitar market. During my years in music retail, I cumulatively spent many hours researching used instruments - especially guitars - for customers to ensure that I could offer a fair price and, if purchased, ask a fair price for an instrument once it was put on display. A tool to help make this process a bit faster would have been great!
