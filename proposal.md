# Galvanize Capstone Proposal #2

1. MTG Competitive Prediction
    1. To build on top of my first Capstone project, I will widen the scope of my tournament result data. In this project I will inspect distributions of card choices, as well as ratios of card types and converted mana costs among deck sub- and super-types.
    2. Can deck statistics such as land/spell ratios, card choices, average converted mana cost and mana curve predict the winner of a game?

2. Age of Analysis II
    1. `Age of Empires II` is a real-time strategy PC game developed and released by Microsoft in 1999 which still enjoys popularity today. So much so, in fact, that recent years have seen large international tournaments sonsored by names such as Red Bull, and even a remaster & brand new content from Microsoft. In this project I will inspect players' statistics such as competitive ratings, win/loss ratios and streaks to predict the winner of a given matchup.
    2. Can player statistics predict the best civilazation (team) choice to beat a given opponent?
